**dental-appointment folder**: This contains a lightweight prototype using Flask and MongoDB designed to respond to a hypothetical client's problem.
- *Project Brief*: A dental office. Their premises have three clinic rooms. Ten dentists offer their services at this office. Only one administrator is in charge of managing appointments, and they have no formal information system for doing so. The administrator has begun to be overwhelmed due to an increase in patient demand, and they have begun making mistakes in scheduling appointments, leading to anger from both the dentists and the patients. The office is asking your firm to help them develop an information system to manage patient appointments with dentists.
- *Goal*: This project is the culminating activity for ITMGT 130: Informaation Engineering. This demonstrates capabilities of analyzing information system requirements through modeling and prototyping.
- *Supporting Diagrams*: Functional requirements, user stories, conceptual model, BPMN 2.0, relational data model
