Instructions:

def savings(gross_pay, tax_rate, expenses):
    '''Savings.
    5 points.

    This function calculates the money remaining
        for an employee after taxes and expenses.

    To get the take-home pay of an employee, we will
        follow the following process:
        1. Apply the tax rate to the gross pay of the employee; round down
        2. Subtract the expenses from the after-tax pay of the employee

    Parameters
    ----------
    gross_pay: int
        the gross pay of an employee for a certain time period, expressed in centavos
    tax_rate: float
        the tax rate for a certain time period, expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.12)
    expenses: int
        the expenses of an employee for a certain time period, expressed in centavos

    Returns
    -------
    int
        the number of centavos remaining from an employee's pay after taxes and expenses

    pass


def material_waste(total_material, material_units, num_jobs, job_consumption):
    '''Material Waste.
    5 points.

    This function calculates how much material input will be wasted
        after running a certain number of jobs that consume
        a set amount of material.

    To get the waste of a set of jobs:
        1. Multiply the number of jobs by the material consumption per job.
        2. Subtract the total material consumed from the total material available.

    The users of this function also want you to format the output as a string, annotated with the
        units in which the material is expressed. Do not add a space between the number and the unit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    total_material: int
        the total material available
    material_units: str
        the units used to express a quantity of the material (e.g., "kg", "L", etc.)
    num_jobs: int
        the number of jobs to run
    job_consumption: int
        the amount of material consumed per job

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the amount of remaining material expressed with its unit (e.g., "10kg").
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.

    pass 


def interest(principal, rate, periods):
    '''Interest.
    5 points.

    This function calculates the final value of an investment after
        gaining simple interest over a number of periods.

    To calculate simple interest, simply multiply the principal to the quantity (rate * time).
        Add this amount to the principal to get the final value.

    Round down the final amount.

    Parameters
    ----------
    principal: int
        the principal (i.e., starting) amount invested, expressed in centavos
    rate: float
        the interest rate per period, expressed as a decimal representation of a percentage (e.g., 3% is 0.03)
    periods: int
        the number of periods invested

    Returns
    -------
    int
        the final value of the investment
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.
    # Stay within the function. Only use the parameters as input. The function should return your answer.
    pass

def shift_letter(letter, shift):
    '''Shift Letter.
    5 points.

    Shift a letter right by the given number.
    Wrap the letter around if it reaches the end of the alphabet.

    Examples:
    shift_letter("A", 0) -> "A"
    shift_letter("A", 2) -> "C"
    shift_letter("Z", 1) -> "A"
    shift_letter("X", 5) -> "C"
    shift_letter(" ", _) -> " "

    *Note: the single underscore `_` is used to acknowledge the presence
        of a value without caring about its contents.

    Parameters
    ----------
    letter: str
        a single uppercase English letter, or a space.
    shift: int
        the number by which to shift the letter.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the letter, shifted appropriately, if a letter.
        a single space if the original letter was a space.

def shift_by_letter(letter, letter_shift):
    '''Shift By Letter.
    10 points.

    Shift a letter to the right using the number equivalent of another letter.

def vigenere_cipher(message, key):
    '''Vigenere Cipher.
    15 points.

    Encrypts a message using a keyphrase instead of a static number.
    Every letter in the message is shifted by the number represented by the
        respective letter in the key.
    Spaces should be ignored.

    Example:
    vigenere_cipher("A C", "KEY") -> "K A"

    If needed, the keyphrase is extended to match the length of the key.
        If the key is "KEY" and the message is "LONGTEXT",
        the key will be extended to be "KEYKEYKE".

    Parameters
    ----------
    message: str
        a string of uppercase English letters and spaces.
    key: str
        a string of uppercase English letters. Will never be longer than the message.
        Will never contain spaces.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the message, shifted appropriately.

    pass


def scytale_cipher(message, shift):
    '''Scytale Cipher.
    15 points.

    Encrypts a message by simulating a scytale cipher.

    A scytale is a cylinder around which you can wrap a long strip of
        parchment that contained a string of apparent gibberish. The parchment,
        when read using the scytale, would reveal a message due to every nth
        letter now appearing next to each other, revealing a proper message.
    This encryption method is obsolete and should never be used to encrypt
        data in production settings.

    You may read more about the method here:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale

    You may follow this algorithm to implement a scytale-style cipher:
    1. Take a message to be encoded and a "shift" number.
        For this example, we will use "INFORMATION_AGE" as
        the message and 3 as the shift.
    2. Check if the length of the message is a multiple of
        the shift. If it is not, add additional underscores
        to the end of the message until it is.
        In this example, "INFORMATION_AGE" is already a multiple of 3,
        so we will leave it alone.
    3. This is the tricky part. Construct the encoded message.
        For each index i in the encoded message, use the character at the index
        (i // shift) + (len(message) // shift) * (i % shift) of the raw message.
        If this number doesn't make sense, you can play around with the cipher at
         https://dencode.com/en/cipher/scytale to try to understand it.
    4. Return the encoded message. In this case,
        the output should be "IMNNA_FTAOIGROE".

    Example:
    scytale_cipher("INFORMATION_AGE", 3) -> "IMNNA_FTAOIGROE"
    scytale_cipher("INFORMATION_AGE", 4) -> "IRIANMOGFANEOT__"
    scytale_cipher("ALGORITHMS_ARE_IMPORTANT", 8) -> "AOTSRIOALRH_EMRNGIMA_PTT"

    Parameters
    ----------
    message: str
        a string of uppercase English letters and underscores (underscores represent spaces)
    shift: int
        a positive int that does not exceed the length of message

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the encoded message
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.
    # Stay within the function. Only use the parameters as input. The function should return your answer.
    pass


def scytale_decipher(message, shift):
    '''Scytale De-cipher.
    15 points.

    Decrypts a message that was originally encrypted with the `scytale_cipher` function above.

    Example:
    scytale_decipher("IMNNA_FTAOIGROE", 3) -> "INFORMATION_AGE"
    scytale_decipher("AOTSRIOALRH_EMRNGIMA_PTT", 8) -> "ALGORITHMS_ARE_IMPORTANT"
    scytale_decipher("IRIANMOGFANEOT__", 4) -> "INFORMATION_AGE_"

    There is no further brief for this number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    message: str
        a string of uppercase English letters and underscores (underscores represent spaces)
    shift: int
        a positive int that does not exceed the length of message

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the decoded message
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.
    # Stay within the function. Only use the parameters as input. The function should return your answer.
    pass
